# DesafioVR Project
This project is based on a challenge proposed by the Data Migration Team at Â© VR Software.

The project consists of a system for registering products, stores, and both. It was created using:
- Angular 16.2.10
- Spring Framework 3.2.2
- Gradle 8.5
- JDK 17.0.10
- PostgreSQL 12

# Getting Started
First, create a PostgreSQL database.

In the API, configure the "application.properties" with the information of the database that was configured and run it in your IDE (IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc) to start the system.

In Angular, run it in the terminal (PowerShell, Git, etc) using the command "ng serve --open" to open the project in your default browser.
